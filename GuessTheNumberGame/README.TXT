Project: Guess The Number Game
	Project Description:
		Create a console-based game where the computer generates a random number, and the user has to guess the number within a
		certain range.

	Basic Features:
		Random Number Generation: The computer generates a random number within a specified range (e.g., between 1 and 100).

		User Input: The user inputs their guess for the number.

		Feedback: Provide feedback to the user after each guess, indicating whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low.

		Replay: Allow the user to play the game again after each round.

	Additional Features (if time permits):
		Limited Attempts: Set a limit on the number of attempts the user has to guess the correct number.

		Difficulty Levels: Implement different difficulty levels with varying ranges for the random number.

		Score Tracking: Keep track of the user's score based on the number of attempts.

	Technical Considerations:
		User Interface: Keep the user interface simple, displaying messages and accepting input.

		Random Number Generation: Use Java's Random class to generate random numbers.

		Code Structure: Use appropriate classes and methods. Follow good coding practices.

		Error Handling: Implement basic error handling for user input.

Project Timeline:
	Week 1:
	Set up the project structure and initialize the version control system (e.g., Git).
	Implement random number generation and basic game mechanics.
	Test the basic functionality.

	Week 2:
	Add additional features based on priority.
	Refactor and improve the code.
	Implement error handling.
	Perform thorough testing.
	Document the code and create a simple user guide.

	Notes:
	Use Java programming language.
	Break down the project into smaller tasks and tackle them one at a time.
	Regularly commit your code to version control.
	Don't hesitate to ask for help or clarification if needed.
