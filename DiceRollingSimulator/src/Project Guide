User Input:
    Allow the user to input the number of dice they want to roll.
    Take input for the number of sides on each die (common options are 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20-sided dice).

Rolling the Dice:
    Simulate the rolling of the dice based on user input.
    Generate random numbers for each die within the specified range of sides.

Display Results:
    Print or display the results of each die roll to the user.
    Sum up the total value if multiple dice are rolled.

Repeat or Exit:
    Ask the user if they want to roll the dice again or exit the program.
    Implement a loop to allow the user to roll the dice multiple times if desired.

Error Handling:
    Validate user input to ensure it falls within acceptable ranges (e.g., a positive number of dice, valid sides on each die).
